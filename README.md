# Captionator

Captionator is an image captioning project that utilizes attention mechanisms to generate descriptive captions for images. 

The system works by analyzing the contents of an image and using a neural network to generate a caption that accurately describes what is happening in the image. The attention mechanism allows the system to focus on specific parts of the image when generating the caption, improving the accuracy and specificity of the generated text. The Captionator project has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, such as image search engines, accessibility tools for visually impaired individuals, and social media platforms that require automatic image captioning.
